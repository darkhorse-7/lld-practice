Software is not built to be perfect on day one. It is built to evolve.

The YAGNI principle reminds us to stay grounded in reality. Code for what is needed now. When the time comes to evolve or extend, you will have the clarity and simplicity to do it well.

So next time you think:

“Let’s add this now, just in case…”

Pause, and ask yourself: “Is there a real need for this today?”

If not, then you probably aren’t gonna need it.
