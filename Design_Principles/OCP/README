# Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

## Definition

**Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

In simple terms: **you should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code**.

---

## Why OCP Matters

* Reduces risk of breaking existing code
* Makes systems easier to maintain
* Encourages clean design using abstractions

---

## ❌ Violates OCP (Bad Design)

Adding a new discount requires modifying existing logic.

```java
class Discount {
    double calculate(String type, double amount) {
        if (type.equals("STUDENT")) return amount * 0.9;
        if (type.equals("SENIOR")) return amount * 0.8;
        return amount;
    }
}
```

**Problem:** Every new discount forces a change in this class.

---

## ✅ Follows OCP (Good Design)

Use abstraction to allow extension without modification.

```java
interface Discount {
    double apply(double amount);
}

class StudentDiscount implements Discount {
    public double apply(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.9;
    }
}

class SeniorDiscount implements Discount {
    public double apply(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.8;
    }
}
```

```java
class Bill {
    double calculate(double amount, Discount discount) {
        return discount.apply(amount);
    }
}
```

**Result:** New discounts are added as new classes. Existing code stays unchanged.

---

## Key Takeaway

> **Extend behavior by adding new classes, not by changing existing ones.**

Use **interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism** to apply OCP effectively.
