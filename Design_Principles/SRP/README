Concise SRP Rule:
"One class = One job. If you use 'and' to describe it, split it."

Quick Check:
If your class changes for multiple unrelated reasons, it's doing too much.

Example:
❌ EmployeeManager → "Manages employees and sends emails and saves to database"
✅ Split into: Employee, EmailSender, DatabaseSaver

Simple Test:
Can you change your class because of Tax law changes without affecting Database code? If no → violates SRP.
