KEEP IT SIMPLE, YOU STUPID

the calc implemented there can be done via interface also which is just over complecating things

Final Thought
The best code is the code that’s easiest to understand—not the code that impresses other developers with cleverness.

Keeping things simple does not mean dumbing things down. It means choosing clarity over cleverness, readability over abstraction, and function over form.

So the next time you write a class, ask yourself: "Can I make this simpler?"

Because good design starts with keeping it simple.

Here in this file we've made a utility class for EmailValidator since the logic is generic and can be used across various places .. but that is just over complicating stuffs right there
