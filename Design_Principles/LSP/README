if the subclass can't honour every promise of the super class it shouldn't extent it.

eg:
class bird
    // can eat
    // can fly
class sparrow implements bird
    // can honor both
class penguin implements bird
    // couldn't honor both
    // violation
    // doesn't exits

use interface -->
interface bird
    // eat
interface flyable
    // eat 
    // fly
sparrow can extend flyable
penguin can extend bird

thats the way it should be
